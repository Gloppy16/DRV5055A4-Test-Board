DRV5055A4 Test Board

Currently under developemnt. Use with caution.

If you use JLCPBC, the DRV5055 will be upside down for some reason and it will try to add pins to the test points.
Uncheck the test points (Quantity of 8) and flip the DRV5055.

The traces on the bottom and test points are for another project. They serve no purpose for the DRV5055.

If the board is made without the low pass filter, as it is in its current configuration, then you will need to add a solder blob that bridges the J1 jumper.
