DRV5055A4 Test Board

Currently under developemnt. Use with caution.

If a low pass filter is added, you must cut the JP1 Jumper. Removing the jumper from the design will also work.


5 boards are $20 assembled (Without headers) from JLCPCB.

The following render has the low pass filter in place. If the boards are made from the fabrication files, the low pass components (R1 and C1) will not be populated.
